# Courses Info App

I designed and developed this fully functional app using `Xcode` and `SwiftUI` in the second week of a two-week project. 

The app can store and modify the information of all the courses the user inputs, whether they are the courses the user is currently taking, has taken, or is going to take in the future.

It is able to store all the courses information onto the physical device so the data wonâ€™t be reset once the app is closed.

Because it is using the new Apple framework `SwiftUI`, it automatically supports new features like Dark Mode, but that also makes the app only loadable on iOS devices running iOS 13 or higher, as older systems does not support `SwiftUI`.
